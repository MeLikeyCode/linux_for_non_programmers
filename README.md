# Linux for Non-programmers
This (mini) book teaches you (a non-programmer) about the *fundamentals* of linux. 
1. It assumes you are an absolute beginner (thus everything will be taught, nothing will be assumed). 
2. Only the really important and very commonly used concepts/tools will be covered.
3. You will get enough of a foundation to be able to discover and learn additional concepts/tools by yourself.
